<b>Ana:</b> How do I get the key piece now, O'Malley. I can’t get up there and there doesn't seem to be anything else I can do...
<b>O'Malley:</b> Well, ain't that something. You're so well protected now. It's a shame it isn't getting you anywhere. Maybe you need to go to the other locations first?
<b>Ana:</b> You think so?
<b>O'Malley:</b> Sure, of course, that must be it.
<b>Ana:</b> So, I'm stuck? There must be something I can do!
<b>O'Malley:</b> Sure there is. But first, you need to take off that suit, Ana.
