<b>O’Malley:</b> How did it go? I don’t see any key on you...
<b>Ana:</b> The tailor lied!
<b>O'Malley:</b> Oh? Why do you think he lied?
<b>Ana:</b> Because the suit didn't help me at all! It prevented me from doing exactly the things I needed to do to get the key pieces.
<b>O'Malley:</b> Were you not safe as he promised you'd be?
<b>Ana:</b> Yes...but...
<b>O'Malley:</b> And wasn’t that what you wanted?
<b>Ana:</b> Yes...but I want to live a full life, too. I've felt stuck and suffocated for too long, not knowing how to move forward. I tried everything.
<b>O'Malley:</b> Not everything, apparently.
<b>Ana:</b> Then show me! Show me what to do!
<b>O'Malley:</b> You're sure?
<b>Ana:</b> Not really. I’m scared. But I’m also tired of being scared. So...show me.
<b>O'Malley:</b> Just so we are clear, when we start this, you have to go through with it. No calling upon Soteria this time. Do you trust me?
<b>Ana:</b> I...I trust you….
<b>O'Malley:</b> Then take off that suit.
<b>Ana:</b> But...it’s the only thing that really kept me safe!
<b>O'Malley:</b> And stuck, remember? You just said so yourself.
<b>Take suit off:</b>
