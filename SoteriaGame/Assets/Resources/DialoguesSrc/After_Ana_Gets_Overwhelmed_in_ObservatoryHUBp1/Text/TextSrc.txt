<b>Ana:</b> I knew I should have stayed on the path!
<b>O'Malley:</b> Cause that was working out so well...
<b>Ana:</b> And this worked out better?
<b>O'Malley:</b> At least you tried. It might take some practice...
<b>Ana:</b> Practice? You know how horrible that feels? Feeling lost? Or judged? Questioned in my entire existence? I came here to finally claim my dreams. To be able to live them. Live a full life. Not a life full of constraints and fears and limitations. And I feel like i’m further away from that goal than I’ve ever been. The harder I try, the worse it gets. I just find more and more problems...
<b>O'Malley:</b> That’s it then? Wanna give up? Want to let the Shadows win?
<b>Ana:</b> Stop pushing me. Stop making fun of me! I’m done with you. You don't help. I don't trust you. I CAN'T HANDLE THIS ANYMORE. It's too much!
<b>O'Malley:</b> Suit yourself.
<b>Ana:</b> I'll find the help I need. There must be a way around those Shadows. I'll deal with this my way.
