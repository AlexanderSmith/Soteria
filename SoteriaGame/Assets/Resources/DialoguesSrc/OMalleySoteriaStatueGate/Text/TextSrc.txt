<b>O'Malley:</b> You know what Soteria stands for, Ana? She’s the Goddess of Safety. This whole town - your town - worships her. It’s Soteria who stands between you and your dreams.
<b>Ana:</b> Soteria? What about Oicys? He’s the monster, isn’t he?
<b>O'Malley:</b> Two sides of the same coin. One was born of fear, the other of the desire to avoid that fear. Don’t let either side fool you.
<b>Ana:</b> So what do I do now? I have the key. But Soteria still blocks the path.
<b>O'Malley:</b> Say your “open sesame”.
