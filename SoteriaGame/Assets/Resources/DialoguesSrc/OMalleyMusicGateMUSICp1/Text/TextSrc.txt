<b>O'Malley:</b> Well, well, well...look who’s here...our little dream catcher... [chuckles] ...I may be blind, but even I can see you are a long way away from claiming your dreams...
<b>Ana:</b> What do you know about that? Who are you?
<b>O'Malley:</b> You can call me O’Malley. I know nothing you don’t know yourself, Ana. And you’ve got a ways to go, girl, before you can take on Oicys and take command over those dreams of yours.
<b>Ana:</b> That doesn’t sound very encouraging. I want to be able to live my dreams, but I really don’t know how to move forward. These creatures are horrifying and the gate’s locked. What do you expect me to do?
<b>O'Malley:</b> I don’t expect anything. The question is what YOU want. That gate’s locked because you’re still a puppet, afraid of your own voice, always worried about straying from the path.
<b>Ana:</b> That’s just rude...
<b>O'Malley:</b> Yeah, well...I just make you hear what you already know. You need to find the key to unlock the gate. It’s been broken into three pieces. You won’t like where you have to go or what you have to do to find them.
<b>Ana:</b> [Worried] Where would I find them?
<b>O'Malley:</b> Where it’s darkest and scariest, obviously. To places that know no safety and that feel most confining. What do you think this is all about? Follow the arrow.
<b>Ana.:</b> [Sigh] I’ll try...but I really don’t want to do this...
