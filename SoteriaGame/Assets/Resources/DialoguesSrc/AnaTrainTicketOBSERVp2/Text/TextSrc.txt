<b>Ana:</b> I don’t like trains much. I had to take the train to my first job interview. I couldn’t sleep all night because I was worrying about missing my stop. I kept thinking ‘What if getting on this train is already the wrong decision? What if taking the job is the wrong decision? How can I know this works out? How can I know I’m on the right track? How can I make sure?
