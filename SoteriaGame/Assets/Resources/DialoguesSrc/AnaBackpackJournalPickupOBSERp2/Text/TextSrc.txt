<b>Ana:</b> A part of me is curious about foreign places, would like to see something new. But when I think about it, it scares me. What if no one speaks my language? What if I lose my wallet, my passport? What if I get sick? The mere thought makes my heart race. It’s just too much...better stay away from it.
