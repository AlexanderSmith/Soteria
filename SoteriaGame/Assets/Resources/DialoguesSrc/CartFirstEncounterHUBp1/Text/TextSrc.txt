<b>Cartographer:</b> I’m so glad you made it here safe and sound, Ana Carmena. I heard you had a dreadful encounter with the Shadows on the way here. What a blessing that Soteria was there to save you. Never let go of her token, you hear me?
<b>Ana:</b> Yeah, that was really scary. Do I need to go back out there to get my dreams back?
Cartographer: I’m afraid so! It’s a shame the tailor isn’t in, yet. He could be enormously helpful. His specialty is protective clothing. Maybe you’ll try him later. For now, if I can’t talk you out of it, let me at least give you this device: it will always point towards where you need to go. Also, you should head over to my good friend P.T. at Soteria Power Systems.
