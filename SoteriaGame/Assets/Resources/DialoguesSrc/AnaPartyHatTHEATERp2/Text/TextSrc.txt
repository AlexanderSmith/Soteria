<b>Ana:</b> A party hat...I wish I could have fun at parties, but I never followed an invitation. How many people would be there? What if I didn't know anyone? What if I spilled a drink? What if I didn’t like the food? What if I started panicking? It would be mortifying if people noticed. No, certainly not the feeling I want to invite along on my quest!
