<b>P.T.:</b> Ana, nice to see you! I've helped fight the Shadows with Soteria's light for decades now. Here, take this Spirit lamp. It's an older model and only has one flash shot, but it's free! The Shadows hate it! Recharge here anytime you want - stay safe.
<b>P.T.:</b> May Soteria's Spirit protect you, Ana.
<b>Ana:</b> Guess my dreams lie that way. Better get going. Though I REALLY don't want to...even with compass and lamp, my stomach is all knots...
