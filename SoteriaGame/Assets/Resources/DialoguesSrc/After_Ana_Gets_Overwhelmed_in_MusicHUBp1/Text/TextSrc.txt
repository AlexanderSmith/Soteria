<b>O'Malley:</b> That went well...what happened? Did the big beasty scare you?
<b>Ana:</b> That...was horrible!
<b>O'Malley:</b> What were you trying to do?
<b>Ana:</b> I saw the key piece in the organ pipes. I knew I had to get to it, because you said so. But I have no idea how...
<b>O'Malley:</b> What happened?
<b>Ana:</b> Those instruments, they looked tortured, bound, as if someone wanted to prevent them from making any sound. When I stepped on the tile, I made all that noise come out. 
<b>O'Malley:</b> How did that make you feel?
<b>Ana:</b> Embarrassed about the sound I made. Like I had done something forbidden. But also angry when that creature sucked the sound away. Powerless, too, because I couldn’t do anything about it. Just...really torn between wanting to let out the music and dreading it.
<b>O'Malley:</b> Hm...maybe you should explore a little further. Learn more about this place and its dark secrets?
<b>Ana:</b> I don’t know how more of this I can take.
<b>O'Malley:</b> You want to live your dreams, yes?
<b>Ana:</b> Yes, but there’s a limit to what I can stand! You didn’t see that monster. You don’t know what it was like.
