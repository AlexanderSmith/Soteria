<b>O'Malley:</b> What happened, Ana?
<b>Ana:</b> These eyes - they made me feel like the whole world was staring at me. Right into my soul.
<b>O'Malley:</b> And that’s a problem?
<b>Ana:</b> I don’t want to be judged. I get nervous and then they’ll think I’m weird.
<b>O'Malley:</b> Did you see the key piece?
<b>Ana:</b> Yes, it was in the middle of that strange pit on the stage, with a puppet version of me dangling over it. It was absolutely horrifying.
<b>O'Malley:</b> Hm...what do you think it means?
<b>Ana:</b> I don’t know. But I felt so exposed, so helpless, powerless. Like I was that puppet and I was about to fall into that pit. That pit looked like death to me!
<b>O'Malley:</b> So that means you won’t go after the key?
<b>Ana:</b> I can’t!
<b>O'Malley:</b> You mean you won’t…
<b>Ana:</b> [Angry] I’m NOT doing it, is what I mean!
<b>O'Malley:</b> Well, if that’s all you can handle right now...there’s one more location to be explored, Ana. Your nifty little compass will surely point the way.
<b>Ana:</b> If this is going to be more of the same, I’d rather quit. I mean it. I can’t do this much longer…
