# Soteria

Soteria is a 2D, single player, steam punk adventure game, in which the player as Ana Carmena reclaims her dreams from the evil Shadow Toad by facing her fears. The game is informed by psychology research and aims to promote mental and emotional readiness for the use of effective strategies to overcome general anxiety disorder.

Soteria provides, through metaphor and subversion of traditional game mechanics, an illustration of both anxiety’s ability to rob someone of their agency and the ways in which anxiety can be combatted and conquered.

Soteria’s main gameplay consists of Ana’s exploration of her inner landscape. The brightly lit city center functions as Ana’s safe zone from the creatures of shadow that roam the streets and alleys – but remaining contained to this small and static world is no way to rejuvenate her passionate spirit. The primary goal is to solve three puzzles representing the aspects of anxiety itself that keep Ana stuck. Each guides the player to an epiphany about how to free Ana and themselves – the most liberating choice, however, may not be the safest.

Soteria employs a metaphorical approach to communicate its message, get players engaged and to provide an experience that makes you think about what it all means, thus reinforcing reflection.

Soteria does not claim to be a cure for anxiety, but to promote mental and emotional readiness to use effective, yet counter-intuitive strategies to overcome fears. As Reid Wilson put it: for anxiety treatment to be effective, people need to “get with the program”.
